# 2D Graphing Simulator

This project is a 2D Graphing Simulator that allows users to input mathematical equations and visualize their graphs. The simulator is built using HTML, JavaScript, and the Chart.js library for rendering 2D graphs. It also uses Math.js to parse and evaluate the mathematical expressions.

## Features

- **2D Graphing**: Plot 2D graphs of mathematical functions.
- **Interactive Input**: Enter equations in the form of `y = f(x)` and update the graph dynamically.
- **Data Table**: Toggle to show a table of calculated values for the function.

## Installation

No installation is required. Simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

## Usage

1. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.
2. Enter a mathematical equation in the input field (e.g., `y = x^2`).
3. Click the "Graph" button to plot the graph.
4. Click the "Toggle Table" button to show or hide the table of calculated values.

## Libraries and Tools Used

- **[Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/)**: A JavaScript library for creating 2D charts.
- **[Math.js](https://mathjs.org/)**: A JavaScript library for mathematical operations.
- **HTML/CSS**: For structuring and styling the application.
- **JavaScript**: For adding interactivity and logic.

## Code Structure

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that contains the structure and elements of the application.
- Inline JavaScript: Contains the logic for plotting graphs, evaluating equations, and generating tables.
- Inline CSS: Provides basic styling for the application.

## Example

Here is an example of how to use the 2D Graphing Simulator:

1. Open the application in your browser.
2. In the input field, type `y = x^2`.
3. Click "Graph". The graph of the equation `y = x^2` will be plotted on the screen.
4. Click "Toggle Table" to see the table of values for `x` from -5 to 5.
